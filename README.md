Project name: Travel Planning Helper

## What does this project do?
The user first enters the traffic budget and selects the current location. The program shows the area where you can go from that location, and the user chooses the area you want to go. The program then shows the means of transportation, each price and time. If the user chooses, the program will show the remaining budget, and ask users to continue traveling to another area. If the total cost exceeds the traffic budget after the user chooses the means of transportation, the program tells the user that transportation costs exceeded the budget. After finishing the plan, the program shows and make textfile about the total transportation cost and time and tourist attractions in each area that user decided to go.

## Why is this project useful?
If you move without planning when you travel in Korea, traffic expenses often exceed traffic budgets, and sometimes you take too much traffic time. The program prevents that situation, and show time and money to spend on total transportation, and informs tourist attractions in the travel area. Finally, you can receive your total plan as a text file.
